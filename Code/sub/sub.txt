1
00:00:18,022 --> 00:00:20,216
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:20,216 --> 00:00:21,634
I'm Sam,

3
00:00:21,634 --> 00:00:24,400
and I just turned 17.

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,647
A few years ago,
before my freshman year in High School,

5
00:00:27,647 --> 00:00:32,851
I wanted to play snare drum
in the Foxboro High School Marching Band,

6
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:35,588
and it was a dream
that I just had to accomplish.

7
00:00:35,588 --> 00:00:37,851
But each snare drum and harness

8
00:00:37,851 --> 00:00:40,154
weighed about 40 pounds each,

9
00:00:40,155 --> 00:00:42,770
and I have a disease called Progeria.

10
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,858
So just to give you an idea,
I weigh only about 50 pounds.

11
00:00:46,857 --> 00:00:51,614
So, logistically, I really couldn't carry
a regular sized snare drum,

12
00:00:51,615 --> 00:00:55,654
and because of this the band director
assigned me to play

13
00:00:55,654 --> 00:00:59,005
pit percussion during the halftime show.

14
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:01,109
Now pit percussion was fun.

15
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:04,802
It involved some really cool
auxiliary percussion instruments,

16
00:01:04,802 --> 00:01:08,622
like the bongos, timpani,

17
00:01:08,623 --> 00:01:11,106
and timbales, and cowbell.

18
00:01:11,106 --> 00:01:13,317
So it was fun,

19
00:01:13,317 --> 00:01:18,420
but it involved no marching,
and I was just so devastated.

20
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,914
However, nothing was going 
to stop me

21
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,585
from playing snare drum
with the marching band

22
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,009
in the halftime show.

23
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:29,865
So my family and I worked
with an engineer to design

24
00:01:29,864 --> 00:01:31,792
a snare drum harness

25
00:01:31,793 --> 00:01:35,580
that would be lighter,
and easier for me to carry.

26
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:39,638
So after continuous work, we made

27
00:01:39,638 --> 00:01:43,859
a snare drum apparatus
that weighs only about 6 pounds.

28
00:01:43,858 --> 00:01:48,128
(Applause)

29
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:52,427
I just want to give you some more
information about Progeria.

30
00:01:52,427 --> 00:01:58,340
It affects only about
350 kids today, worldwide.

31
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,880
So it's pretty rare,

32
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:03,334
and the effects of Progeria include:

33
00:02:03,334 --> 00:02:07,407
tight skin, lack of weight gain,
stunted growth,

34
00:02:07,408 --> 00:02:09,010
and heart disease.

35
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:12,585
Last year my Mom 
and her team of scientists

36
00:02:12,586 --> 00:02:16,725
published the first successful
Progeria Treatment Study,

37
00:02:16,724 --> 00:02:19,460
and because of this
I was interviewed on NPR,

38
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,006
and John Hamilton asked me
the question:

39
00:02:22,006 --> 00:02:24,271
"What is the most important thing

40
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:26,537
that people should know about you?"

41
00:02:26,538 --> 00:02:29,264
And my answer was simply that

42
00:02:29,264 --> 00:02:31,691
I have a very happy life.

43
00:02:31,691 --> 00:02:35,762
(Applause)

44
00:02:35,762 --> 00:02:39,663
So even though
there are many obstacles in my life,

45
00:02:39,663 --> 00:02:42,533
with a lot of them
being created by Progeria,

46
00:02:42,532 --> 00:02:45,094
I don't want people to feel bad for me.

47
00:02:45,094 --> 00:02:47,801
I don't think about
these obstacles all the time,

48
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:51,007
and I'm able to overcome
most of them anyway.

49
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:56,132
So I’m here today, to share with you
my philosophy for a happy life.

50
00:02:56,132 --> 00:03:00,757
So, for me,
there are 3 aspects to this philosophy.

51
00:03:00,757 --> 00:03:04,830
So this is a quote
from the famous Ferris Bueller.

52
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,516
The first aspect to my philosophy is that

53
00:03:08,515 --> 00:03:11,551
I’m okay with what I ultimately can’t do

54
00:03:11,551 --> 00:03:14,031
because there is so much I can do.

55
00:03:14,032 --> 00:03:16,799
Now people sometimes 
ask me questions like,

56
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:19,252
&quot;Isn’t it hard living with Progeria?&quot;, or

57
00:03:19,252 --> 00:03:22,569
"What daily challenges
of Progeria do you face?"

58
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:26,052
And I’d like to say that,
even though I have Progeria,

59
00:03:26,052 --> 00:03:28,686
most of my time
is spent thinking about things

60
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:31,534
that have nothing to do
with Progeria at all.

61
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:36,435
Now this doesn’t mean that I ignore
the negative aspects of these obstacles.

62
00:03:36,435 --> 00:03:38,491
When I can’t do something like

63
00:03:38,491 --> 00:03:42,557
run a long distance,
or go on an intense roller coaster,

64
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,582
I know what I’m missing out on.

65
00:03:44,582 --> 00:03:48,498
But instead,
I choose to focus on the activities

66
00:03:48,498 --> 00:03:52,275
that I can do through things
that I’m passionate about,

67
00:03:52,276 --> 00:03:55,790
like scouting, or music, or comic books,

68
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,756
or any of my favorite Boston sports teams.

69
00:03:58,756 --> 00:04:01,861
Yeah, so --
(Laughter)

70
00:04:01,861 --> 00:04:06,001
However, sometimes I need to find
a different way to do something

71
00:04:06,001 --> 00:04:07,712
by making adjustments,

72
00:04:07,711 --> 00:04:11,798
and I want to put those things
in the "can do" category.

73
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:14,802
Kind of like you saw
with the drum earlier.

74
00:04:14,802 --> 00:04:16,512
So here’s a clip

75
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,951
with me playing Spider-Man

76
00:04:18,951 --> 00:04:21,760
with the Foxboro High School 
Marching Band

77
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,863
at halftime a couple of years ago.

78
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:25,967
(Video)

79
00:04:26,648 --> 00:04:32,026
♫ Spider-Man theme song ♫

80
00:05:07,115 --> 00:05:10,622
(Applause)

81
00:05:10,622 --> 00:05:12,548
Thank you.

82
00:05:12,548 --> 00:05:14,920
All right, all right, so --

83
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,225
That was pretty cool,

84
00:05:16,225 --> 00:05:19,560
and so I was able
to accomplish my dream

85
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,116
of playing snare drum
with the marching band,

86
00:05:22,117 --> 00:05:25,009
as I believe I can do
for all of my dreams.

87
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:30,167
So hopefully, you can accomplish
your dreams as well, with this outlook.

88
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,381
The next aspect to my philosophy is

89
00:05:32,382 --> 00:05:36,817
that I surround myself
with people I want to be with,

90
00:05:36,817 --> 00:05:38,633
people of high quality.

91
00:05:38,634 --> 00:05:42,680
I’m extremely lucky
to have an amazing family,

92
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,110
who have always supported me
throughout my entire life.

93
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,489
And I’m also really fortunate to have

94
00:05:48,488 --> 00:05:51,497
a really close group of friends 
at school.

95
00:05:51,497 --> 00:05:55,050
Now we’re kind of goofy,
a lot of us are band geeks,

96
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,412
but we really enjoy 
each other’s company,

97
00:05:57,411 --> 00:06:00,433
and we help each other out 
when we need to.

98
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:04,562
We see each other
for who we are on the inside.

99
00:06:04,562 --> 00:06:06,865
So this is us goofing off a little bit.

100
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:09,372
So we’re juniors in High School now,

101
00:06:09,372 --> 00:06:15,129
and we can now mentor
younger band members,

102
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:16,986
as a single collective unit.

103
00:06:16,985 --> 00:06:19,915
What I love about
being in a group like the band,

104
00:06:19,915 --> 00:06:22,834
is that the music
that we make together,

105
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:28,242
is true, is genuine,
and it supersedes Progeria.

106
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:29,875
So I don’t have to worry about that

107
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:33,870
when I’m feeling so good
about making music.

108
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,564
But even having made 
a documentary,

109
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:38,975
going on TV a couple of times,

110
00:06:38,975 --> 00:06:41,459
I feel like I’m at my highest point

111
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:45,607
when I’m with the people
that surround me every day.

112
00:06:45,607 --> 00:06:49,005
They provide the real
positive influences in my life,

113
00:06:49,004 --> 00:06:54,699
as I hope I can provide
a positive influence in theirs as well.

114
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:58,247
(Applause)

115
00:06:58,247 --> 00:06:59,436
Thank you.

116
00:06:59,435 --> 00:07:01,394
So the bottom line here,

117
00:07:01,394 --> 00:07:05,293
is that I hope you appreciate
and love your family,

118
00:07:05,293 --> 00:07:08,452
love your friends,
for you guys, love you Bro’s

119
00:07:08,452 --> 00:07:11,859
and acknowledge your mentors,

120
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,557
and your community,

121
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:16,653
because they are a very real
aspect of everyday life,

122
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:20,980
they can make a truly significant,
positive impact.

123
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,663
The third aspect to the philosophy is,

124
00:07:23,663 --> 00:07:25,898
Keep moving forward.

125
00:07:25,898 --> 00:07:29,686
Here’s a quote by a man
you may know, named Walt Disney,

126
00:07:29,685 --> 00:07:31,495
and it’s one of my favorite quotes.

127
00:07:31,495 --> 00:07:34,230
I always try to have something
to look forward to.

128
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:37,265
Something to strive for
to make my life richer.

129
00:07:37,264 --> 00:07:38,955
It doesn’t have to be big.

130
00:07:38,956 --> 00:07:41,338
It could be anything from

131
00:07:41,338 --> 00:07:43,946
looking forward to
the next comic book to come out,

132
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:46,467
or going on a large family vacation,

133
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,735
or hanging out with my friends,

134
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,690
to going to the next
High School football game.

135
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:55,012
However, all of these things
keep me focused,

136
00:07:55,012 --> 00:07:57,850
and know that there’s
a bright future ahead,

137
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:02,286
and may get me through
some difficult times that I may be having.

138
00:08:02,286 --> 00:08:07,794
Now this mentality includes staying
in a forward thinking state of mind.

139
00:08:07,795 --> 00:08:11,389
I try hard not to waste energy
feeling badly for myself,

140
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:14,871
because when I do,
I get stuck in a paradox,

141
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,454
where there’s no room for 
any happiness or any other emotion.

142
00:08:19,454 --> 00:08:23,014
Now, it’s not that I ignore
when I’m feeling badly,

143
00:08:23,014 --> 00:08:24,896
I kind of accept it,

144
00:08:24,896 --> 00:08:28,272
I let it in, 
so that I can acknowledge it,

145
00:08:28,273 --> 00:08:31,775
and do what I need to do 
to move past it.

146
00:08:31,774 --> 00:08:35,081
When I was younger,
I wanted to be an engineer.

147
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,995
I wanted to be an inventor,

148
00:08:36,995 --> 00:08:40,009
who would catapult the world
into a better future.

149
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:42,183
Maybe this came 
from my love of Legos,

150
00:08:42,183 --> 00:08:44,501
and the freedom of expression 
that I felt

151
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:47,813
when I was building with them.

152
00:08:47,813 --> 00:08:53,488
And this was also derived
from my family and my mentors,

153
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:57,985
who always make me feel whole,
and good about myself.

154
00:08:57,985 --> 00:09:01,133
Now today my ambitions
have changed a little bit,

155
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:03,609
I’d like to go into the field of Biology,

156
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:07,948
maybe cell biology, or genetics,

157
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:12,417
or biochemistry, or really anything.

158
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:15,697
This is a friend of mine,
who I look up to,

159
00:09:15,697 --> 00:09:19,251
Francis Collins, the director of the NIH,

160
00:09:19,251 --> 00:09:22,669
and this is us at TEDMED last year,
chatting away.

161
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:26,207
I feel that no matter what
I choose to become,

162
00:09:26,207 --> 00:09:29,520
I believe that I can change the world.

163
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,416
And as I’m striving to change the world,
I will be happy.

164
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:36,562
About four years ago,

165
00:09:36,562 --> 00:09:39,246
HBO began to film a documentary

166
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:42,281
about my family and me
called “Life According to Sam”.

167
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:46,285
That was a pretty great experience,
but it was also four years ago.

168
00:09:46,284 --> 00:09:49,760
And like anyone, my views
on many things have changed,

169
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,164
and hopefully matured,
like my potential career choice.

170
00:09:54,164 --> 00:09:58,798
However, some things have stayed 
the same throughout that time.

171
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:02,678
Like my mentality,
and philosophy towards life.

172
00:10:02,678 --> 00:10:04,730
So I would like to show you

173
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,921
a clip of my younger self from the film,

174
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:11,492
that I feel embodies that philosophy.

175
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:12,658
(Video)

176
00:10:12,658 --> 00:10:16,313
I know more about it genetically.

177
00:10:16,313 --> 00:10:19,856
So it’s less of an embodiment now.

178
00:10:19,856 --> 00:10:21,334
It used to be like

179
00:10:21,335 --> 00:10:24,134
this thing that prevents me
from doing all this stuff,

180
00:10:24,134 --> 00:10:26,668
that causes other kids to die,

181
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,639
that causes everybody 
to be stressed,

182
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:35,275
and now
it’s a protein that is abnormal,

183
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:39,072
that weakens the structure of cells.

184
00:10:40,465 --> 00:10:42,076
So,

185
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:45,457
and it takes a burden
off of me because now

186
00:10:45,457 --> 00:10:48,209
I don’t have to think about

187
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:51,802
Progeria as an entity.

188
00:10:55,904 --> 00:10:57,506
Okay, pretty good, huh?

189
00:10:57,506 --> 00:11:01,596
(Applause)

190
00:11:01,596 --> 00:11:02,671
Thank you.

191
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:05,990
So, as you can see I’ve been
thinking this way for many years.

192
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,435
But I’d never really had to apply
all of these aspects of my philosophy

193
00:11:10,434 --> 00:11:14,175
to the test at one time, 
until last January.

194
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:19,009
I was pretty sick, I had a chest cold,
and I was in the hospital for a few days,

195
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:23,600
and I was secluded from 
all of the aspects of my life that I felt

196
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,124
made me, me,

197
00:11:25,124 --> 00:11:27,951
that kind of gave me my identity.

198
00:11:27,951 --> 00:11:31,028
But knowing
that I was going to get better,

199
00:11:31,028 --> 00:11:34,009
and looking forward to a time
that I would feel good again,

200
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:36,658
helped me to keep moving forward.

201
00:11:36,658 --> 00:11:39,211
And sometimes I had to be brave,

202
00:11:39,211 --> 00:11:41,003
and it wasn’t always easy.

203
00:11:41,003 --> 00:11:42,617
Sometimes I faltered,

204
00:11:42,616 --> 00:11:44,362
I had bad days,

205
00:11:44,363 --> 00:11:47,857
but I realized that being brave
isn’t supposed to be easy.

206
00:11:47,856 --> 00:11:51,956
And for me, I feel it’s the key way
to keep moving forward.

207
00:11:51,956 --> 00:11:54,181
So, all in all,

208
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:57,725
I don’t waste energy
feeling bad for myself.

209
00:11:57,725 --> 00:12:01,040
I surround myself with people
that I want to be with,

210
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:03,317
and I keep moving forward.

211
00:12:03,317 --> 00:12:06,688
So with this philosophy,
I hope that all of you,

212
00:12:06,688 --> 00:12:08,765
regardless of your obstacles,

213
00:12:08,765 --> 00:12:11,612
can have a very happy life as well.

214
00:12:11,613 --> 00:12:13,131
Oh, wait, hang on a second,

215
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,619
one more piece of advice –-

216
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:17,219
(Laughter)

217
00:12:17,219 --> 00:12:19,709
Never miss a party if you can help it.

218
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:22,084
My school’s homecoming dance
is tomorrow night,

219
00:12:22,085 --> 00:12:24,168
and I will be there.

220
00:12:24,168 --> 00:12:25,640
Thank you very much.

221
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:31,294
(Applause)
