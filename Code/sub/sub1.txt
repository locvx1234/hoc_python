Hello everyone.
I'm Sam,
and I just turned 17.
A few years ago,
before my freshman year in High School,
I wanted to play snare drum
in the Foxboro High School Marching Band,
and it was a dream
that I just had to accomplish.
But each snare drum and harness
weighed about 40 pounds each,
and I have a disease called Progeria.
So just to give you an idea,
I weigh only about 50 pounds.
So, logistically, I really couldn't carry
a regular sized snare drum,
and because of this the band director
assigned me to play
pit percussion during the halftime show.
Now pit percussion was fun.
It involved some really cool
auxiliary percussion instruments,
like the bongos, timpani,
and timbales, and cowbell.
So it was fun,
but it involved no marching,
and I was just so devastated.
However, nothing was going 
to stop me
from playing snare drum
with the marching band
in the halftime show.
So my family and I worked
with an engineer to design
a snare drum harness
that would be lighter,
and easier for me to carry.
So after continuous work, we made
a snare drum apparatus
that weighs only about 6 pounds.
I just want to give you some more
information about Progeria.
It affects only about
So it's pretty rare,
and the effects of Progeria include:
tight skin, lack of weight gain,
stunted growth,
and heart disease.
Last year my Mom 
and her team of scientists
published the first successful
Progeria Treatment Study,
and because of this
I was interviewed on NPR,
and John Hamilton asked me
the question:
that people should know about you?"
And my answer was simply that
I have a very happy life.
So even though
there are many obstacles in my life,
with a lot of them
being created by Progeria,
I don't want people to feel bad for me.
I don't think about
these obstacles all the time,
and I'm able to overcome
most of them anyway.
So I’m here today, to share with you
my philosophy for a happy life.
So, for me,
there are 3 aspects to this philosophy.
So this is a quote
from the famous Ferris Bueller.
The first aspect to my philosophy is that
I’m okay with what I ultimately can’t do
because there is so much I can do.
Now people sometimes 
ask me questions like,
of Progeria do you face?"
And I’d like to say that,
even though I have Progeria,
most of my time
is spent thinking about things
that have nothing to do
with Progeria at all.
Now this doesn’t mean that I ignore
the negative aspects of these obstacles.
When I can’t do something like
run a long distance,
or go on an intense roller coaster,
I know what I’m missing out on.
But instead,
I choose to focus on the activities
that I can do through things
that I’m passionate about,
like scouting, or music, or comic books,
or any of my favorite Boston sports teams.
Yeah, so --
However, sometimes I need to find
a different way to do something
by making adjustments,
and I want to put those things
in the "can do" category.
Kind of like you saw
with the drum earlier.
So here’s a clip
with me playing Spider-Man
with the Foxboro High School 
Marching Band
at halftime a couple of years ago.
♫ Spider-Man theme song ♫
Thank you.
All right, all right, so --
That was pretty cool,
and so I was able
to accomplish my dream
of playing snare drum
with the marching band,
as I believe I can do
for all of my dreams.
So hopefully, you can accomplish
your dreams as well, with this outlook.
The next aspect to my philosophy is
that I surround myself
with people I want to be with,
people of high quality.
I’m extremely lucky
to have an amazing family,
who have always supported me
throughout my entire life.
And I’m also really fortunate to have
a really close group of friends 
at school.
Now we’re kind of goofy,
a lot of us are band geeks,
but we really enjoy 
each other’s company,
and we help each other out 
when we need to.
We see each other
for who we are on the inside.
So this is us goofing off a little bit.
So we’re juniors in High School now,
and we can now mentor
younger band members,
as a single collective unit.
What I love about
being in a group like the band,
